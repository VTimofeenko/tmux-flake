# Deprecation note

This flake has been merged into my [main config](https://github.com/VTimofeenko/monorepo-machine-config).

# My tmux configuration flake

This is a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) that configures tmux.

The prefix key is set to `CTRL-F`.

All shortcuts defined in `./tmux.conf` can be viewed by hitting `<F1>` after prefix key.

Some shortcuts (like jumping to previous prompt) rely on specific prompt configuration and may need tweaking.
